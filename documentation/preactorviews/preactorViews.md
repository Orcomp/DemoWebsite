Rantt can be used to view Preactor data.

In order to display Preactor data in Rantt you will need to create some views.

Please download the following [zip file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5SM6iAQ6u64RjZSZmF4VTc3bkU/view?usp=sharing).

Instructions
=============

The file contains two scripts.

These scripts will create two views, one for **operations** and the other for **calendar periods**.

Run FunctionsAndProcedures.sql first, then the CreateViews.sql.

Feel free to edit the views in order to add more fields as appropriate. (The operations view is very basic, so it will require more fields.)
