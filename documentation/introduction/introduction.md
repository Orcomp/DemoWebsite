The Rantt (**R**esource G**antt**) application was developed by [Simply Effective Solutions](wwww.sesolutions.net.au) as a tool to allow greater flexibility and visibility around viewing data associated with scheduling and simulation data.

It can be used as a Management communication tool to present timed stamped data in a more meaningful way, and turns data into information that is easily explorable.

The Rantt application only requires minimal data to represent it in a Gantt chart.
