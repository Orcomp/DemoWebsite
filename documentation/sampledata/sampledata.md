- Globex
- LargeScheduleHorizon
- MultiDataset
- Port
- TransArcticRail
- xlsElsinore: Same project as Elsinore but the data is in an Excel spreadsheet
- xlsFinoflex: Same project as Finoflex but the data is in an Excel spreadsheet

ActualPlanned
=============

- Displays two datasets side by side (i.e there are two separate operation files)
- Compare various scheduled
- Compare schedule with actual shop floor perfromance
